## Welcome!

This is the [Center for Translational Neurophysiology of Speech and Communication (CTNSC)](https://www.iit.it/it/ctnsc-unife). An [IIT](https://www.iit.it/it/home) research center based in [Unife](https://www.unife.it/it).

The aim of the center is twofold. On one hand, we are studying how the brain builds communicative and linguistic representations (Speech and Communication Team). On the other hand, we are designing new brain interfaces, specifically conceived for human use, to transduce and computationally decode neural signals (Neurotechnologies Team). A focus of the Center is on communication because we believe that many paralyzing pathologies require, at first, the restoring of an efficient communicative flow between the patient and the environment.
